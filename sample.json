    "Abstract": "Â© 2015 Elsevier Ltd.Adequate access to effective and affordable vaccines is essential for the prevention of mortality due to infectious disease. Pneumonia - a consequence of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection - is the world's leading cause of death in children aged under 5 years. The development of a needle-free, thermostable pneumococcal-conjugate vaccine (PCV) could revolutionise the field by reducing cold-chain and delivery constraints. Skin patches have been used to deliver a range of vaccines, with some inducing significantly higher vaccine-specific immunogenicity than needle-injected controls in pre-clinical models, though they have yet to be used to deliver a PCV. We dry-coated a licensed PCV onto a microprojection-based patch (the Nanopatch) and delivered it to mouse skin. We analysed resulting anti-polysaccharide IgG responses. With and without adjuvant, anti-polysaccharide IgG titres induced by Nanopatch immunisation were significantly higher than dose-matched intramuscular controls. These improved responses were primarily obtained against pneumococcal serotypes 4 and 14. Importantly, capsule-specific IgG correlated with functionality in an opsonophagocytic killing assay. We demonstrate enhanced anti-PCV immunogenicity when delivered by Nanopatch over intramuscular injection. As the first study of a PCV delivered by a skin vaccination technology, this report indicates the potential for reduced costs and greater global distribution of such a vaccine.",
